#The Roadmap of My Academic and Career Journey #[MyPhoto](C:/Users/ajose35/Desktop/L'ecole/MADA-course/AsmithJoseph-MADA-portfolio/.quarto/Myphotos/IMG_0191%20(2).jpg)

#Hi there! I’m Asmith Joseph, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and a researcher at the Global Health Institute. Originally from sunny Tampa, Florida, my academic adventure began with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences and public health. Along the way, I explored my love for languages by earning a Master’s in French and Applied Linguistics at the University of South Florida. To top it off, I completed my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at Florida International University.

#My passion lies in unraveling the complexities of infectious diseases, especially HIV-tuberculosis co-infection in low- to middle-income countries. My research aims to improve tuberculosis treatments, enhance control strategies, and address the reproductive health challenges faced by those affected. I have worn many hats in the field of public health. As an ORISE Fellow at the CDC, I tackled evaluation activities that helped drive meaningful change. Before that, I served as an Epidemiologist with the Emerging Infections Program at Emory University, focusing on surveillance for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2 in Atlanta. My journey also includes time as a Clinical Research Coordinator at the University of South Florida and the University of Miami. There, I managed multiple clinical studies, including trials on HIV/AIDS, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, cognitive performance in older adults, and tobacco cessation. Through it all, my goal has been clear: to combine science, data, and human connection to make a global impact on health.

#My Data Adventure (So Far!)

#Throughout my educational and professional journey, I’ve had the opportunity to explore various data and software tools. While I wouldn’t call myself an expert (far from it), I’ve developed a fundamental working knowledge of statistical and data analysis tools. I’ve used SAS, SPSS, EpiInfo, RedCap, Python, and R to analyze and manage datasets, and for qualitative work, I’ve worked with Dedoose and Qualtrics to navigate survey data and thematic analysis. I’m the first to admit there’s plenty of room for growth. That’s why I’m eager to dive into a Modern Applied Data Analysis course, where I aim to build more vigorous modeling, data visualization, and practical analytics skills. I desire to move beyond the basics and gain confidence in applying these techniques to solve real-world problems. For me, data analysis is a learning process—challenging but always rewarding when the results come together.

#Beyond the Books: My Passion in the Kitchen

#Cooking is my happy place. I love experimenting with new recipes, blending flavors, and creating something delicious from scratch. It’s my ultimate stress reliever (and let’s be honest, much needed during this rollercoaster of a PhD journey!).

#Once I finally wrap up this chapter of academia, I dream of taking my love for cooking to the next level by attending culinary school. And if I’m dreaming big—because why not? I’d love to study in Paris or Italy, soaking in the rich food culture and learning from the best.

#Sure, it’s a far-fetched idea, but I’ve always believed in aiming high. Whether it’s unraveling the complexities of epidemiology or perfecting the art of a soufflé, I’m determined to chase the things that light me up inside.

#For now, I’ll keep practicing in my kitchen, dreaming of the day I can create dishes worthy of a chef—or at the very least, wow my friends with a picture-perfect crème brûlée. Until then, it’s just me, my whisk, and my PhD—tackling one challenge at a time!
